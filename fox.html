  font-size: 22px;"> Once a cat and a fox were discussing about hounds."I hate hounds," said the fox.
"So do I," said the cat.
"They are swift runners," said the fox, "but they can't catch me, I know many tricks to get away from them."
"What tricks can you perform ?" asked the cat.
"A lot of tricks." boasted the fox. "I can run along a thorny hedge. I can hide amidst thick bushes. I can hide in burrows. These are only a few of the many tricks that I can perform," said the fox.
"I know only one good trick," said the cat.
"How sad! Only one trick? What is it?" asked the fox.
"I am going to do it just now. Look out, the hounds are coming," said the cat and ran up a nearby tree.There she was safe from the hounds.
The hounds chased the fox. He tried one trick after another. But the hounds caught him at last and killed him.
"My one trick is better than all the tricks of the poor fox," said the cat to herself
