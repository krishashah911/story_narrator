  font-size: 22px;"> Once upon a time there lived a very old tiger in A jungle. When he lost the strength and speed of his youth, he thought, "Now I can't hunt any more.
I must find out some trick to save myself from starvation."
After thinking for a long time, the tiger hit upon a plan. He proclaimed, "Now I am very old. Therefore,
I will spend the rest of my life piously. I will live on fruits and grass and chant the name of God all the time. Birds and animals of the jungle need not fear me any more."
Some innocent animals believed every word of the tiger. "What a great saint!" they said. "We must go and pay our respects to him." So every day a few animals went to meet him in his cave. The tiger jumped upon the innocent animals and ate them. Thus he managed to keep off starvation.
A fox came to know about the saintly tiger. He said to himself, "I can't believe it. How can a tiger ever live on fruits and grass? I must go and find out the truth myself."
So one day the fox went to the tiger's cave. He stopped at the entrance of the cave. Very carefully and minutely he examined the footprints of the animals who had visited the cave earlier. He noticed that all the footprints pointed towards the cave. There was no sign of footprints going out of the cave. So he said,
"I don't want to die to keep this false saint alive,"
and went away.
